### Key Design Decisions

#### 🎯 **App Router Over Pages Router**

- Chose Next.js 14 App Router for its superior developer experience
- Server Components by default for better performance
- Built-in loading and error boundaries
- Simplified data fetching patterns

#### 🔄 **URL-First State Management**

- All filters, search, and pagination state stored in URL parameters
- Enables shareable links that restore exact application state
- Improves SEO and user experience
- Eliminates complex client-state management needs

#### ⚡ **Optimistic UI Patterns**

- Immediate visual feedback for user interactions
- Favorites toggle responds instantly while syncing to localStorage
- Reduces perceived loading times and improves user satisfaction

#### 🎨 **Component-First Architecture**

- Strict separation between UI, business logic, and data fetching
- Custom hooks encapsulate complex state logic
- Reusable components with TypeScript props validation
- Consistent design system with variant-based styling

#### 📱 **Mobile-First Responsive Design**

- Tailwind CSS utility classes for rapid development
- Grid layouts that adapt from 1 column (mobile) to 4 columns (desktop)
- Touch-friendly interactive elements
- Optimized images with Next.js Image component
